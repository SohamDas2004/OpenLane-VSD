# OpenLane-VSD
OpenLane is an ASIC infrastructure library based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.

A reference flow, "Classic", performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can find the documentation ![link](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/) to get started. You can discuss OpenLane 2 in the #openlane-2 channel of the Efabless Open Source Silicon Slack.
